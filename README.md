# Installation
This skin is designed to be used on a phpVMS installation on a subdomain. Your main website will be static webpages without phpVMS.
This skin has been tested on the nabeelio/phpVMS repository running on PHP version 5.3. PHP templates are also included in the 'php_templates' folder.

1. Download phpVMS and this skin. 
    If you are running phpVMS 5.5.x, move and replace all the files in the 'php_templates' folder into the main 'crew_center' folder and it should run as normal.
2. Create a subdomain of your website (e.g. crew.yourdomain.com) and install phpVMS.
3. Create a folder named 'crewcenter' in the lib/skins directory of your phpVMS installation.
3. Move all files from this repository into the folder named 'crewcenter'.
4. Log in to the phpVMS admin center, navigate to 'General Settings', then select the 'crewcenter' skin.
